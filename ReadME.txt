Hello, This is a spreadsheet made for pokemon crystal. The intention is to minimize having to go to serebii but also being able to see what pokemon would be best to farm. This spreadsheet follows a few rules.

1. Use the highest minimum level of each route.

2. If a route has multiple of the same minimum encouter level I chose the one with the best encounter rates.

3. If a route has multiple areas that all have same encouter rate and minimum encounter level I listed all of them.

4. If Rule 3 applies but there are too many to list; I just chose the easiest to farm (This was usually Surfing/Fishing and resulted in being a city).

5. The specific purpose is for farming EXP; therefore, if a pokemon is a static/gift encouter it recieves an N/A (Exception was the Electrodes since there are multiple of them). If you want to find out where they are please visit a website that will tell you, my favorite is serebii.net https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-gs/.

6. I excluded Route 28 and Silver Cave, These seem to be be end/post game encounters so I didn't include them.

7. The intended exclusions for the list are for you to be able to grind on either johto or Kanto half of the game; Therefore encouters that require you to go to the Kanto side or 2nd half but can be encountered in Johto are excluded from Johto side.

8. Rule for Silver Cave only encouters are that it gets !!! next to the location, if route 28 is the only location it applies the same, if route 28 and silver cave are both the only location you can encouter I listed route 28.

9. When calculating EXP I only took into account Base exp, and Level part of the equation, the rest are either 1.5 times boosts or .5 times boosts, which will be expected if you use the items You can find the formula here https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience#Gain_formula.

10. EXP calculations might be slightly off due to rounding but this shouldn't be more than + or - 1 exp point.
